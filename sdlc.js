// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/


// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the secound step, in which a detailed list of things the software needs to do in order to meet its end goal and deliver needed features is made and the resources need to meet these requirements are estimated. "
const Design = "This is the third step, in which specifications generated from the Analysis of Requirements step are used to make a detailed plan of how the software will be made.This plan is then shared with stakeholders and may be adapted based on their feedback. During this step, develpers may also develop an early prototype and show this to their stakeholders."
const Implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which the software is written according to the specifications agreed upon in the design step. Some preliminary testing will also be carried out on pieces of code as their written to ensure that they work." 
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which all features of the code are tested to find and remove glitches that were not spotted in earlier stages of development or only developed after other pieces of code were added."
const Maintain = "This is the final stage in software development, in which the software continues to be modified after deployment in order to remove bugs not spotted during earlier stages of development, maintain compatability with other related systems as they are updated and add new features that became needed due to changes in requirements after deloyment or were postponed until after deployment in order to speed up previous stages of the development cycle and release the software sooner."
